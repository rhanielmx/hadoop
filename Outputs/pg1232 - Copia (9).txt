things ought done retain state composed divers elements louis xii king france father people born 1462 died 1515 charles viii king france born 1470 died 1498 king louis brought italy ambition venetians desired obtain half state lombardy intervention blame course taken king wishing get foothold italy friends seeing rather every door shut owing conduct charles forced accept friendships could get would

forli lords faenza pesaro rimini camerino piombino lucchese pisans sienese everybody made advances become friend could venetians realize rashness course taken order might secure two towns lombardy made king master two thirds italy let one consider little difficulty king could maintained position italy observed rules laid kept friends secure protected although numerous weak timid afraid church venetians thus would always forced stand means could easily made secure remained powerful sooner milan contrary assisting pope alexander occupy romagna never occurred action weakening depriving friends thrown lap whilst aggrandized church adding much temporal power spiritual thus giving greater authority committed prime error obliged follow much put end ambition alexander prevent becoming master tuscany forced come italy enough aggrandized church deprived friends wishing kingdom naples divided king spain prime arbiter italy takes associate ambitious country malcontents somewhere shelter whereas could left kingdom pensioner king drove put one able drive louis turn wish acquire truth natural common men always praised blamed cannot yet wish means folly blame therefore france could attacked naples forces ought done could ought divided partition made venetians lombardy justified excuse got foothold italy partition merited blame excuse necessity therefore louis made five errors destroyed minor powers increased strength one greater powers italy brought foreign power settle country send colonies errors lived enough injure made sixth taking away dominions venetians aggrandized church brought spain italy would reasonable necessary humble first taken steps ought never consented ruin powerful would always kept others designs lombardy venetians would never consented except become masters others would wish take lombardy france order give venetians run counter would courage one say king louis yielded romagna alexander kingdom spain avoid answer reasons given

allowed church reach greatness fact seen greatness church spain italy caused france ruin may attributed general rule drawn never rarely fails cause another becoming powerful ruined predominancy brought either astuteness else force distrusted raised power chapter iv kingdom darius conquered alexander rebel successors alexander death considering difficulties men hold newly acquired state might wonder seeing alexander great became master asia years died whilst scarcely settled whence might appear reasonable whole empire would rebelled nevertheless successors maintained meet difficulty arose among ambitions answer principalities one record found governed two different ways either prince body servants assist govern kingdom ministers favour permission prince barons hold dignity antiquity blood grace prince barons states subjects recognize lords hold natural affection states governed prince servants hold prince consideration country one recognized superior yield obedience another minister official bear particular affection examples two governments time turk king france entire monarchy turk governed one lord others servants dividing kingdom sanjaks sends different administrators shifts changes chooses king france placed midst ancient body lords acknowledged subjects beloved prerogatives king take away except peril therefore considers states recognize great difficulties seizing state turk conquered great ease holding causes difficulties seizing kingdom turk usurper cannot called princes kingdom hope assisted designs revolt lord around arises reasons given ministers slaves bondmen corrupted great difficulty one expect little advantage corrupted cannot carry people reasons assigned hence attacks turk must bear mind find united rely strength revolt others turk conquered routed field way cannot replace armies nothing fear family prince exterminated remains one fear others credit people conqueror rely victory ought fear contrary happens kingdoms governed like france one easily enter gaining baron kingdom one always finds malcontents desire change men reasons given open way state render victory easy wish hold afterwards meet infinite difficulties assisted crushed enough exterminated family prince lords remain make heads fresh movements unable either satisfy exterminate state lost whenever time brings opportunity consider nature government darius find similar kingdom turk therefore necessary alexander first overthrow field take country victory darius killed state remained secure alexander reasons successors united would enjoyed securely ease tumults raised kingdom except provoked impossible hold tranquillity states constituted like france hence arose frequent rebellions romans spain france greece owing many principalities states long memory endured romans always held insecure possession power long continuance empire memory passed away romans became secure possessors fighting afterwards amongst one able attach parts country according authority assumed family former lord exterminated none romans acknowledged things remembered one marvel ease alexander held empire asia difficulties others keep acquisition pyrrhus many occasioned little abundance ability conqueror want uniformity subject state chapter v concerning way govern cities principalities lived laws annexed whenever states acquired stated accustomed live laws freedom three courses wish hold first ruin next reside person third permit live laws drawing tribute establishing within oligarchy keep friendly government created prince knows cannot stand without friendship interest utmost support therefore would keep city accustomed freedom hold easily means citizens way example spartans romans spartans held athens thebes establishing oligarchy nevertheless lost romans order hold capua carthage numantia dismantled lose wished hold greece spartans held making free permitting laws succeed hold compelled dismantle many cities country truth safe way retain otherwise ruining becomes master city accustomed freedom destroy may expect destroyed rebellion always watchword liberty ancient privileges rallying point neither

accustomed live prince family exterminated one hand accustomed obey hand old prince cannot agree making one amongst know govern reason slow take arms prince gain secure much easily republics vitality greater hatred desire vengeance never permit allow memory former liberty rest safest way destroy reside chapter vi concerning new principalities acquired one arms ability let one surprised speaking entirely new principalities shall adduce highest examples prince state men walking almost always paths beaten others following imitation deeds yet unable keep entirely ways others attain power imitate wise ought always follow paths beaten great men imitate supreme ability equal least savour let act like clever archers designing hit mark yet appears far distant knowing limits strength bow attains take aim much higher mark reach strength arrow great height able aid high aim hit mark wish reach say therefore entirely new principalities new prince less difficulty found keeping accordingly less ability acquired state fact becoming prince private station presupposes either ability fortune clear one things mitigate degree many difficulties nevertheless relied least fortune established strongest facilitates matters prince state compelled reside person come ability fortune risen princes say moses cyrus romulus theseus like excellent examples although one may discuss moses mere executor god yet ought admired favour made worthy speak god considering cyrus others acquired founded kingdoms found admirable particular deeds conduct shall considered found inferior moses although great preceptor examining actions lives one cannot see owed anything fortune beyond opportunity brought material mould form seemed best without opportunity powers mind would extinguished without powers opportunity would come vain necessary therefore moses find people israel egypt enslaved oppressed egyptians order disposed follow delivered bondage necessary romulus remain alba abandoned birth order become king rome founder fatherland necessary cyrus find persians discontented government medes medes soft effeminate long peace theseus could shown ability found athenians dispersed opportunities therefore made men fortunate high ability enabled recognize opportunity whereby country ennobled made famous valorous ways become princes like men acquire principality difficulty keep ease difficulties acquiring rise part new rules methods forced introduce establish government security ought remembered nothing difficult take hand perilous conduct uncertain success take lead introduction new order things innovator enemies done well old conditions lukewarm defenders may well new coolness arises partly fear opponents laws side partly incredulity men readily believe new things long experience thus happens whenever hostile opportunity attack like partisans whilst others defend lukewarmly wise prince endangered along necessary therefore desire discuss matter thoroughly inquire whether innovators rely depend others say whether consummate enterprise use prayers use force first instance always succeed badly never compass anything rely use force rarely endangered hence armed prophets conquered unarmed ones destroyed besides reasons mentioned nature people variable whilst easy persuade difficult fix persuasion thus necessary take measures believe longer may possible make believe force moses cyrus theseus romulus unarmed could enforced constitutions long happened time fra girolamo savonarola ruined new order things immediately multitude believed longer means keeping steadfast believed making unbelievers believe therefore great difficulties consummating enterprise dangers ascent yet ability overcome overcome envied success exterminated begin respected
