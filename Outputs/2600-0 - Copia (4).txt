august battle shevardino redoubt fought twenty fifth shot fired either side twenty sixth battle borodino took place battles shevardino borodino given accepted battle borodino fought least sense either french russians immediate result russians bound brought nearer destruction moscow feared anything world french immediate result brought nearer destruction whole army feared anything world result must quite obvious yet napoleon offered kutuzov accepted battle commanders guided reason would seem must obvious napoleon advancing thirteen hundred miles giving battle probability losing quarter army advancing certain destruction must equally clear kutuzov accepting battle risking loss quarter army would certainly lose moscow kutuzov mathematically clear playing draughts one less go exchanging shall certainly lose therefore exchange opponent sixteen men fourteen one eighth weaker exchanged thirteen men three times strong battle borodino strength proportion french five six battle little one two previously hundred thousand hundred twenty thousand afterwards little fifty thousand hundred thousand yet shrewd experienced kutuzov accepted battle napoleon said commander genius gave losing quarter army lengthening lines communication still said expected end campaign occupying moscow ended previous campaign occupying vienna much evidence contrary napoleon historians tell us smolensk onwards wished stop knew danger extended position knew occupation moscow would end campaign seen smolensk state russian towns left received single reply repeated announcements wish negotiate giving accepting battle borodino kutuzov acted involuntarily irrationally later fit occurred historians provided cunningly devised evidence foresight genius generals blind tools history enslaved involuntary ancients left us model heroic poems heroes furnish whole interest story still unable accustom fact epoch histories kind meaningless question battle borodino preceding battle shevardino fought exists definite well known quite false conception historians describe affair follows russian army say retreat smolensk sought best position general engagement found position borodino russians say fortified position advance left highroad moscow smolensk almost right angle borodino utitsa place battle fought front position say fortified outpost set shevardino mound observe enemy twenty fourth told napoleon attacked advanced post took twenty sixth attacked whole russian army position field borodino histories say quite wrong anyone cares look matter easily convince russians seek best position contrary retreat passed many positions better borodino stop one positions kutuzov wish occupy position chosen popular demand battle yet expressed strongly enough miloradovich yet arrived militia many reasons fact positions passed stronger position borodino one battle fought far strong position spot one might find russian empire sticking pin map hazard russians fortify position field borodino left right angle highroad position battle took place never till twenty fifth august 1812 think battle might fought shown first fact entrenchments twenty fifth begun twenty fifth twenty sixth completed secondly position shevardino redoubt redoubt quite senseless front position battle accepted strongly fortified post efforts exhausted six thousand men sacrificed defend till late night twenty fourth cossack patrol would sufficed observe enemy thirdly proof position battle fought foreseen shevardino redoubt advanced post position fact twenty fifth barclay tolly bagration convinced shevardino redoubt left flank position kutuzov report written hot haste battle speaks shevardino redoubt left flank position much later reports battle borodino written leisure incorrect extraordinary statement invented probably justify mistakes commander chief represented infallible shevardino redoubt advanced post whereas reality simply fortified point left flank battle borodino fought us entrenched position previously selected whereas fought quite unexpected spot almost unentrenched case evidently position selected along river kolocha crosses highroad right angle acute angle left flank shevardino right flank near village novoe center borodino confluence rivers kolocha voyna anyone looks field borodino without thinking battle actually fought position protected river kolocha presents obvious army whose object prevent enemy advancing along smolensk road moscow napoleon riding valuevo twenty fourth see history books say position russians utitsa borodino could seen position exist see advanced post russian army pursuing russian rearguard came upon left flank russian position shevardino redoubt unexpectedly russians moved army across kolocha russians time begin general engagement withdrew left wing position intended occupy took new position foreseen fortified crossing side kolocha left highroad napoleon shifted whole forthcoming battle right left looking russian side transferred plain utitsa semenovsk borodino plain advantageous position plain russia whole battle twenty sixth august took place napoleon ridden evening twenty fourth kolocha ordered immediate attack redoubt begun attack next morning one would doubted shevardino redoubt left flank position battle would taken place expected case probably defended shevardino redoubt left flank still obstinately attacked napoleon center right engagement would taken place twenty fifth position intended fortified attack left flank took place evening retreat rear guard immediately fight gridneva russian commanders wish time begin general engagement evening twenty fourth first chief action battle borodino already lost twenty fourth obviously led loss one fought twenty sixth loss shevardino redoubt found morning twenty fifth without position left flank forced bend back hastily entrench chanced russian army twenty sixth defended weak unfinished entrenchments disadvantage position increased fact russian commanders fully realized happened namely loss position left flank shifting whole field forthcoming battle right left maintained extended position village novoe utitsa consequently move forces right left battle happened throughout whole battle russians opposed entire french army launched left flank half many men poniatowski action utitsa uvarov right flank french actions distinct main course battle battle borodino take place effort conceal commanders mistakes even cost diminishing glory due russian army people described battle borodino fought chosen entrenched position forces slightly weaker enemy result loss shevardino redoubt russians fought battle borodino open almost unentrenched position forces half numerous french say conditions merely unthinkable fight ten hours
