said catherine going pieces somebody start song aleman nodded guitar response began singing capella  la cucaracha cucaracha quiere caminar   voices joined self consciously found song died catherine rubbed fingers together even pockets cold said wryly gilchrist surprised took hands may help said thank sir galahad laughed oh hey mallory guard detail everyone assembled came looked even bulkier half dozen layers clothing gilchrist prepared stand impotently background engineer distributed blarney almost relieved see fear  he  knew word asked catherine yet muttered ave leetle light inquired aleman draws current much surely heaters pump air intake pump pile room mallory voice grew higher working overtime sucking hydrogen ask know nobody wait said catherine eagerly room losing warm gas replace cold stuff outside would account trouble said mallory dully figure hydrogen disappearing anyway make much difference energy output supposed know gilchrist stood trying think brain felt gelid damn damn damn must rational answer believe blundered ugly unknown facet cosmos natural law farthest galaxy item thought wearily pile operating usual except somehow hydrogen lost abnormally fast therefore pump bring triton air item due leak heating pipes still ordinary pressure item gas pipes included radioactive isotope nevertheless item could hydrogen 3 pile working normally neutron leakage enough produce

pump pull hydrogen outside satisfy barystat nitrogen welling time operating quite efficient little ammonia factory though reach equilibrium pressure yield pretty soon haber process catalyst incidentally spongy iron certain promoters potassium aluminum oxides excellent ones words happened hill natural haber catalyst trouble suppose reaction endothermic absorbs heat asked catherine matter fact exothermic pile actually little hotter usual spite warm outside air ammonia considerably higher specific heat hydrogen gas pipes caloric content lower temperature ummm vesey rubbed chin radiation nitrogen plus neutrons gives carbon 14 beta emitter right said catherine tell us repair situation tone light answer obvious escape gilchrist  had  asked speak thinking wishfully turn pile empty pipes
